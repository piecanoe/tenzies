## Overview

### Objective


Develop a Tenzies game where players can click on individual dice to lock in specific numbers. Pressing the "Roll" button generates new numbers on the unfrozen dice. The objective is to align all dice to display the same number, triggering a subdued confetti effect upon achieving victory.

Users should be able to:

- Click a 'die' to hold it
- Held dice should change color
- Click 'Roll' to roll any dice that aren't held
- Once all held dice are matching, confetti will rain down the page
- Player can click 'New Game' to start a new game

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- [Confetti Effect](https://github.com/alampros/react-confetti?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) - This is the Confetti effect I used that triggers when the player wins the game

### Continued development

I would like to add other functions to this application in the future:
- Change numbers into dots
- Track number of rolls it takes to win
- Track time it takes to win
- Save 'Best Time' to localStorage
