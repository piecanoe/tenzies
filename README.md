## Overview

### The challenge

Objective: Roll all ten of your dice to the same number to win the game!

Users should be able to:

- Held dice should be green
- Click 'roll' to roll any dice that aren't held
- Once all held dice are matching, confetti should rain down the page
- Player can click 'new game' to start a new game

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid+3
- [Confetti Effect](https://github.com/alampros/react-confetti?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) - This is the Confetti effect I used that triggers when the player wins the game

### Continued development

I would like to add other functions to this application in the future:
- Change numbers into dots
- Track number of rolls it takes to win
- Track time it takes to win
- Save 'Best Time' to localStorage
